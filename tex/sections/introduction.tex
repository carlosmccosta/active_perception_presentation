\begin{frame}{Context}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Perception of objects with large occlusions is a challenging task that can be tackled using active perception with a moving sensor or with a constellation of sensors.
		\item The creation of a sensor constellation that maximizes the observable surface area of set of target objects is difficult to optimize when there are large occlusions of the objects and when creating a heterogeneous constellation with different types of sensors that have distinct technical characteristics.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Main contributions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Multisensor fusion approach that relies on color segmentation and voxel grid merging of point clouds that were generated in simulated worlds.
		\item RANSAC algorithm for estimating the type, number and disposition of 3D sensors that maximize the target objects observable surface area.
		\item Public release\footnote{\scriptsize\url{https://github.com/carlosmccosta/sensor_placement_optimization}} of source code and dataset with 4 simulation worlds developed for bin picking and active perception use cases with parts with large occlusions.
	\end{itemize}
