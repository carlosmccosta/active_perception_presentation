\section{\scshape Conclusions}
\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The proposed system is able to estimate the N best sensors constellation for maximizing the observable surface area coverage for a given set of target objects.
		\item With a low sensor count the system can compute the best sensor constellation in less than a second, which makes it suitable for active perception tasks.
		\item Future work may include the testing of the proposed approach in conjunction with a object recognition system in order to reliably perform object tracking when an operator is manipulating a target object (by moving the sensor within the environment using a robotic arm).
